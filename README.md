#  dragterm 1.0

Drag and drop from the command-line, updated to use modern API.

The tool itself is called "drag", as that's a lot nicer to type.

Moving the mouse outside of the icon that pops up will terminate the app.

## Notes

Starting a drag without a view (as <https://github.com/ciaran/drag> does) doesn't seem to work properly anymore, hence the transparent window appearing under the mouse.
